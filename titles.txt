// The file uses a set of parameters that, once defined, will be active upon all the messages listed afterwards until they are redefined. These parameters are:
// https://twhl.info/wiki/page/titles.txt
//    $position x y - Defines where on the screen the message will appear.
//      x and y are variables between 0 and 1 that specify how far along the respective
//      axis the message will be, with 0 being left / top and 1 being right / bottom.
//      If set to -1, the message will appear in the center of that axis.
//    $effect x - Sets how the message will appear. x can be:
//      0 - The message will simply fade in and fade out.
//      1 - The message will fade in and out, and will flicker with the highlight colour.
//      2 - The message will appear letter by letter, typewriter-style, with each letter appearing as the highlight colour before changing to the normal colour.
//    $color r g b - Sets the colour of the message.
//    $color2 r g b - Sets the highlight colour of the message.
//    $fadein x - Sets how many seconds the message takes to fade in. If using effect 2, this will set how long each letter takes to appear.
//    $fxtime x - If using effect 2, this sets how long each letter will take, in seconds, to change from the highlight colour to the normal colour as they appear.
//    $holdtime x - Sets how many seconds the message will remain on-screen for. For effect 2, this time starts after the last letter appears.
//    $fadeout x - Sets how many seconds the message takes to fade out.
